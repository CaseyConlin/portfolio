      "This Next.js React site was designed and developed for an Americana musician to offer good SEO discoverability and a fun user experience. The site is written in JavaScript/TypeScript, and utilizes Next.js’s dynamic routing to dynamically generate page info and metadata. The site integrates with the artist’s YouTube channel via YouTube’s API, and features HTML5 audio element components for playing and skipping tracks. Events and gigs are served in an easy to understand format as well as using structured data schema for SEO and web crawlers to read and serve event details in search. The components are Material UI-based React components for a responsive UI with a high accessibility score. The site was designed in Figma and features some parallax on the desktop homepage.",

      "I rebuilt the website for my web development business using Next.js to take advantage of the framework’s server-side rendering which generates a static website on build and provides a handy built-in routing feature and SEO-friendly site structure. Built with React, the site uses Typescript and a combination of Tailwind and SCSS to style the components. Animations are handled with the React Spring library, which gives the transitions and movements a more-natural feeling. The contact form uses the SendGrid API to manage contact form emails, and I included a couple dad jokes at the top of the site for good measure.",

    description:
      "In this modern take on the classic word game Hangman, which is also at the top of this page, players try to find the secret word by guessing letters using the on-screen or their local keyboard. In my updated version, you race to build your rocket before an opposing team builds their own. Each correct letter gets you a little closer to completing and launching your rocket, but each miss adds another piece to the enemy rocket. Controls also allow the user to select how many letters should be in the secret word, and reset the game at any time. Like this website, the game is built using React and TypeScript. Initially built to take advantage of the useContext hook to manage state across several components, the game was refactored to use a component composition model to flatten the app and concentrate state management and logic in a parent component. The words and hints come from API calls to the Words API. Components come from Material UI with additional styling and some exceptions. Animations are managed with the Framer Motion library. Components and functionality are tested with Vitest, Playwright, and Mock Service Worker. The high score component uses an API powered by Express that connects to a MongoDB database with some help from Mongoose. Deployment is managed with Docker on Fly.io",

On the backend Node.js, Express, and Mongoose communicate with collections on MongoDB. The Pet API handles filtering and sorting pets results based on client search params. The Authentication API handles registering users and authenticating users using HTTP-only cookies and JWT. The backend also processes payments using Stripe's API via the Checkout page. On the frontend, React provides the UI, and builds search params and calls to the API. The shopping basket / cart is managed as state using React context in browser local storage. The total cost is transmitted to the backend for processing through Stripe at checkout. Routing is handled clientside by React Router, with the useLoaderData hook making API calls where possible. User authentication state is managed with another React context. The app is styled with Tailwind and uses Typescript.`,
